## 🖥️ Steps to Create the Dashboard 
1. Prepare the Dataset: <br>
Gather and clean data for ODI batting records.<br>
I used https://www.bcci.tv/international/men/stats/odi for the data.<br>
Ensure all columns are formatted correctly (e.g., numerical values for averages, runs, and strike rates).<br>

2. Load Data into Power BI: <br>
Import the dataset using Power BI Desktop.<br>
Verify that all fields are correctly categorized (e.g., numbers, text, etc.).<br>

3. Create Visualizations: <br>
Player Card: 🏆 Use a combination of a Card Visual and an Image to highlight the top player (Sachin Tendulkar in this case).<br>
Data Table: 📋 Use a Table Visual to display statistics for all players.<br>
Filters & Slicers: 🎛️ Add slicers to switch between different batting records.<br>
Custom Formatting: 🎨 Apply appropriate fonts, colors, and alignment for a professional look.<br>
  
4. Enhance Interactivity: 🖱<br>
Use slicers and filters to enable users to view different stats dynamically.<br>
Implement conditional formatting to highlight top performers.<br>

5. Publish and Share: <br>
Save the Power BI file (.pbix) and publish it to Power BI Service if needed.<br>
Share the dashboard link with relevant stakeholders.<br>
